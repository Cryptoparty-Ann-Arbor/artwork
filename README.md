How is this repository organized? Where should I add my artwork?

  * cities_icons: a collection of CryptoParty icons - some cities/groups like to have their own colors!

  * cryptoparty_global_logo_icons: the original CryptoParty logos and icons.
  * handbook_cover: is self-explaining enough.
  * memes: we started a collection of memes about CryptoParty, privacy and encryption. Add more!
  * misc: diverse pictures that don't fit in any of the other categories.
